Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a telegram bot is written in python, it runs as a
standalone telegram bot and
uses `telegram bot API <https://core.telegram.org/bots/api>`_ for doing its job :).
If you want to have some automated replies on your telegram user,
you must use somethings like `Telegram CLI <https://github.com/vysheng/tg>`_ and
run your scripts on top of it.
